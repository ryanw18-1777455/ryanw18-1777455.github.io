        <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
        <h3>This is a simple yet beautiful website, created with HTML and CSS</h3>
        <div>
            <h3 style="padding-left: 5%">Here are some examples of text wrapping around floated images.</h3>

                This is a paragraph that should not be too long. 
            </p>

                This is another paragraph which is longer than the first one, one that is a little bit larger and extends multiple lines.
            </p>

                This time a paragraph so much larger that the paragraph before pales in comparison to the might of the third. This 
                paragraph not only extends multiple lines, but it will extend past the image itself and wrap around to create a 
                beautiful and seamless element on the page. As you read this you now see that the claims before were all correct.

            <p style="border: dotted">This is a little sentence in a different font.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Okay, maybe you don't like fun, but you must appreciate other forms of art.</h3>
